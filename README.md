## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

The site uses various technologies cobbled together. Here's a few of them:

- [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz): a fast, batteries-included static-site generator.
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): an opinionated code formatter.
- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass): makes CSS fun!
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript): superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.

All content for the site is written in _Markdown_ within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)‚Äîan extensible, flexible note-taking app. To export the notes from Obsidian, I rely on the [GitHub Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin.
