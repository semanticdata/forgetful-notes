## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

The site uses various technologies cobbled together. Here's a few of them:

- [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz): a fast, batteries-included static-site generator.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript): superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/): fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/): an extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): data-driven documents for interactive visualizations.
- [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/): a beautiful syntax highlighter.
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) & [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/): mathematical notation rendering.
- [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch): full-text search library.
- [Remark](https://remark.js.org/) & [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype): unified ecosystem for processing markdown and HTML.
- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass): makes CSS fun!
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): an opinionated code formatter.

All content for the site is written in _Markdown_ within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)‚Äîan extensible, flexible note-taking app. To export the notes from Obsidian, I rely on the [GitHub Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin.

## üöÄ Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. A backup deployment is also available on Vercel.
