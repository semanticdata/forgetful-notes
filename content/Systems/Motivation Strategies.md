Practical strategies for cultivating and maintaining [[Motivation|motivation]], with particular attention to approaches that work well with ADHD attention patterns and executive function differences.

## Core Principles

**Start before you feel ready**: Motivation often follows action rather than preceding it. Beginning imperfectly creates momentum that builds genuine engagement.

**Leverage interest-based attention**: Align tasks with personal curiosity, values, or immediate relevance whenever possible to tap into [[Intrinsic Motivation|natural drive]].

**Create artificial urgency**: Use deadlines, body doubling, or time constraints to activate focus when [[Extrinsic Motivation|external structure]] is needed.

## Daily Foundation Strategies

**Morning activation sequence**: Shower, movement, or other activating routine before work
**Consistent wake/start times**: Reduce decision fatigue and create predictable energy patterns
**Movement integration**: Physical activity before mentally demanding tasks improves focus and motivation
**Zero-day prevention**: Commit to doing *something* related to your goals every single day, no matter how small

## Task Management for ADHD

**Eat the frog**: Complete the most challenging or important task first when mental energy is highest
**Single-threading**: Focus on one task at a time—the brain cannot effectively multitask
**Habit gamification**: Turn routine behaviors into game-like systems with clear progress markers
**Perfect is the enemy of started**: Lower the bar for beginning while maintaining standards for completion

## Environmental Design

**Reduce friction**: Make desired behaviors easier to start than undesired ones
**Content consumption audit**: The information you consume shapes your mental patterns and motivation
**Eliminate productivity porn**: Stop researching systems and start implementing simple ones
**Sleep hygiene**: Consistent sleep schedule directly impacts motivation and executive function

## Sustainable Patterns

**[[consistency|Consistency]] over intensity**: Small daily actions compound more effectively than sporadic bursts
**Micro-habits**: Build tiny, easily achievable habits that can grow over time
**Interest rotation**: Accept that ADHD attention cycles between topics—design systems that accommodate this rather than fighting it

These strategies work by **reducing cognitive load** while **increasing immediate rewards**, making it easier for both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to function effectively.
