Motivation is the **internal state that propels individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior**. It's the psychological force that initiates, directs, and maintains action toward achieving specific outcomes.

## Core Components

Motivation operates through three fundamental elements:

**Direction**: What goals or outcomes you move toward
**Intensity**: How much effort you invest in pursuing those goals  
**Persistence**: How long you maintain effort despite obstacles or setbacks

## Why Understanding Motivation Matters

Motivation directly impacts **performance, satisfaction, and well-being**. Understanding its mechanics helps explain why some activities feel effortless while others require significant willpower, and why the same person can be highly motivated in one context but struggle in another.

For individuals with **ADHD**, motivation patterns often differ from neurotypical patternsâ€”particularly around interest-based attention, where engagement depends heavily on personal relevance and immediate feedback rather than long-term consequences.

## Types of Motivation

Motivation manifests in two primary forms:

- **[[Intrinsic Motivation]]**: Drive arising from internal satisfaction and personal fulfillment
- **[[Extrinsic Motivation]]**: Drive arising from external rewards, consequences, or pressures

The interplay between these types significantly affects both the **quality of experience** and **long-term sustainability** of motivated behavior.

## Connection to Action

Understanding your personal motivation patterns enables more effective goal-setting and habit formation. This knowledge supports practical applications found in [[Motivation Strategies|motivation strategies]] and helps explain why certain productivity approaches work better than others.
