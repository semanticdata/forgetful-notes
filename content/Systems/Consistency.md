Show up. Do the work. Be consistent. Things I'm not good at.

Consistency is the compound effect of showing up daily, even when motivation wanes. By consistently showing up and putting in the effort, you build discipline and resilience. Small daily actions accumulate into significant results over time—like interest in a savings account.

## The Two-Day Rule

Never miss twice in a row. This simple rule acknowledges that life happens while preventing one missed day from becoming a broken habit. Missing one day doesn't matter if you resume the next day.

## Start Impossibly Small

Define the smallest possible version of your habit. Want to exercise daily? Begin with one push-up. Want to read more? Start with one page. On your worst days, you can still maintain progress with minimal effort.

## Motivation is Unreliable

Don't rely on motivation—it comes and goes. Systems and environmental design persist. Make good choices easier by removing friction from beneficial habits.

You don't need to be perfect. You need to be consistent. Progress compounds, and time is your ally when you show up reliably.
