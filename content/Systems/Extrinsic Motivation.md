Extrinsic motivation is **motivation driven by external factors** such as rewards, punishments, praise, or social pressure rather than personal satisfaction or inherent enjoyment of the activity itself.

## Types of External Regulation

**External Regulation**: Pure reward/punishment systems (money, grades, deadlines)
**Introjected Regulation**: Internalized external pressures (guilt, shame, ego involvement)
**Identified Regulation**: Accepting external goals as personally important
**Integrated Regulation**: Aligning external requirements with personal values and identity

The closer extrinsic motivation moves toward integration, the more it **resembles and supports [[Intrinsic Motivation|intrinsic motivation]]**.

## When Extrinsic Motivation Works

External motivation can be highly effective for:

- **Starting new behaviors** where intrinsic interest hasn't yet developed
- **Maintaining consistency** in activities that serve long-term goals
- **Providing structure** for individuals who benefit from external frameworks
- **Creating accountability** in collaborative or professional contexts

## Potential Downsides

Over-reliance on external motivation can lead to:

- **Reduced autonomy**: Feeling controlled rather than self-directed
- **Diminished creativity**: Focus on meeting external criteria rather than exploration
- **Fragile persistence**: Motivation disappears when external factors are removed
- **Undermining effect**: Can actually reduce intrinsic interest in previously enjoyed activities

## ADHD Considerations

For individuals with ADHD, extrinsic motivation often works best when it provides **immediate feedback and clear structure** rather than distant consequences. External systems that create artificial urgency or gamification can bridge the gap until intrinsic interest develops.

The key is using external motivation as **scaffolding** that supports the development of more sustainable internal drive, rather than as a permanent replacement for personal engagement.
