Atomic notes are single, self-contained notes that capture **one focused idea** or piece of information. They should be readable and understandable without needing to reference other notes, while still being designed to connect meaningfully with other ideas.

## Writing Atomic Notes

Keep each note **focused on one concept**. A good atomic note should be able to stand alone while answering: What is this idea? Why does it matter? How does it work?

Write in **complete thoughts** rather than fragments. Aim for clarity over brevity—if an idea needs 200 words to be self-contained, that's better than 50 words that leave gaps.

Use **descriptive titles** that clearly indicate the note's single focus. The title should tell someone exactly what concept they'll learn about.

## Connecting Ideas

Atomic notes gain power through **intentional linking**. Each note should connect to related concepts using `[[wiki-style links]]`, building a network of interconnected knowledge rather than isolated fragments.

The atomic principle works within your broader [[Digital Garden|Digital Garden]]—individual notes grow and evolve while maintaining their focused scope. This supports the practice of [[Sweep Your Mind|sweeping your mind]] by providing clear containers for distinct thoughts.

## Common Pitfalls

**Scope creep**: Trying to cover multiple related concepts in one note. If you find yourself writing "and also…" frequently, consider splitting into separate atomic notes.

**Over-fragmentation**: Making notes so small they lose meaning. An atomic note should be complete enough to be useful on its own.

**Weak connections**: Creating isolated notes without considering how they relate to existing knowledge in your system.
