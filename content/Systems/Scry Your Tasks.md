To _scry_ is to see or predict the future by means of a crystal ball. It is also the ability to look at the top cards of your deck and rearrange them in Magic the Gathering. This note was inspired by [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) [Episode 142](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/142) where Myke and Grey discuss scrying your task lists.

In terms of organization, scrying your task list allows you to determine what is the order of 2 to 5 things that _need_ to happen across multiple time horizons. The goal is not just daily planning, but creating a systematic approach to empty your mind of worry by establishing clear priorities.

## Core Philosophy

Your job is not to get through all the to-do items, but to arrange them in the _correct order_. The act of scrying transforms an overwhelming collection of tasks into a manageable sequence of next actions. This process integrates naturally with [[Sweep Your Mind|sweeping your mind]]—first you dump everything out, then you arrange what matters most.

You are _probably_ doing life wrong if you consistently get to the bottom of your to-do list. Let me elaborate: if your to-do list is empty, something about your life _is_ wrong. You are not being ambitious enough. [[Consistency]] in this practice matters more than perfection in execution.

## Understanding 2-5 Item Sweet Spot

Focus on identifying 2 to 5 things that _need_ to happen within your chosen time horizon. This number range works because fewer than 2 items suggests you're not being ambitious enough, while more than 5 items creates overwhelm and overestimates your capacity. The 2-5 range provides enough meaningful work while remaining mentally manageable.

When you scry across different time scales, you address various levels of planning anxiety. Daily scrying focuses on what absolutely must be completed before the day ends, plus what will set up tomorrow for success. Weekly scrying identifies the week's non-negotiable deliverables and meaningful progress markers. Monthly or quarterly scrying determines major milestones that define success and projects with the most impact.

## Focus on Impact

When scrying, distinguish between [[Task Types|mission-critical and time-saving tasks]]. Mission-critical items have immediate need for output or result and create problems if delayed. Time-saving tasks improve future efficiency but can almost always wait.

I draw the line when I can't finish the work day (or week, or month) until these mission-critical tasks are _done_. Time-saving tasks get relegated below the scrying line until mission-critical work is handled.

## Practical Application

The scrying approach works with any task management system, whether digital, analog, or hybrid. Start with your complete task inventory from [[Sweep Your Mind|mind sweeping]], then choose your time horizon and identify mission-critical items within that timeframe. Arrange 2-5 items in order of importance or logical sequence, then draw the line—everything else waits below.

Digital tools can use tags or labels to mark "scried" items and create separate views for different time horizons. Analog systems benefit from a separate section at the top of your list for scried items, with a clear line drawn below. Hybrid approaches might maintain digital capture for mind sweeping while using paper for daily scrying and immediate reference.

Regular review and re-scrying prevents the system from becoming stale. Like the [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] approach, breaking large scried items into smaller, actionable pieces makes them more manageable.

## Common Pitfalls

Over-scrying occurs when you try to prioritize too many items or scry everything. Stick to the 2-5 range—if you have more than 5 "critical" items, some aren't actually critical. Under-scrying happens when you only identify 1 item or avoid the process altogether. Push yourself to find at least 2 meaningful items, and if you truly only have 1 critical task, add items that will set up future success.

Time horizon confusion mixes daily urgencies with monthly goals in the same session. Be explicit about your time horizon before starting and use separate scrying sessions for different scales. Task classification errors happen when treating time-saving tasks as mission-critical because everything feels important. Apply the immediate output test from [[Task Types|task types]]—does this truly require a result today, this week, or this month?

Scrying paralysis spends too much time deciding on perfect order instead of acting. Good enough ordering beats perfect ordering that never happens. Ignoring the line means working on items below the scrying threshold while mission-critical items remain undone. Physically separate or hide below-the-line items until scried items are complete.

## Deeper Purpose

Effective scrying does more than organize tasks—it addresses the anxiety that comes from having too many competing priorities. By clearly establishing what matters most within specific time horizons, you create mental space to focus on execution rather than constant re-evaluation. Regular [[Move Your Body|movement]] can help clarify priorities during scrying sessions, as physical activity often brings mental clarity.

The practice acknowledges a fundamental truth: in any ambitious life, there will always be more good things to do than time to do them. Scrying helps you make peace with this reality while ensuring your limited time goes toward what matters most.
