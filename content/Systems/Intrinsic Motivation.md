Intrinsic motivation is **motivation that arises from within the individual**, driven by personal satisfaction, curiosity, and the inherent enjoyment of an activity rather than external rewards or pressures.

## Three Pillars of Intrinsic Motivation

**Autonomy**: The feeling of choice and self-direction in your actions
**Competence**: The sense of mastery and effectiveness in activities you value  
**Relatedness**: Connection to others and sense of belonging within meaningful relationships

When these three psychological needs are met, intrinsic motivation flourishes naturally.

## Characteristics

Intrinsically motivated behavior tends to be:

- **Self-sustaining**: Continues without external enforcement
- **Creative**: More likely to produce novel solutions and approaches
- **Resilient**: Maintains momentum through setbacks and challenges
- **Satisfying**: Associated with higher well-being and life satisfaction

## ADHD and Intrinsic Motivation

For individuals with ADHD, intrinsic motivation often operates through **interest-based attention**. Activities that align with personal interests, values, or curiosity can generate sustained focus that might be difficult to achieve through willpower alone.

This explains why someone with ADHD might hyperfocus on personally meaningful projects while struggling with tasks that feel imposed or irrelevant.

## Relationship to Other Motivation

Intrinsic motivation can be **undermined by excessive [[Extrinsic Motivation|extrinsic rewards]]**, particularly when those rewards feel controlling rather than supportive. However, well-designed external structure can actually **support** intrinsic motivation by providing the framework within which autonomy can flourish.

The key insight: intrinsic motivation is not about working in isolation, but about feeling **personally invested** in the outcomes you're pursuing.
