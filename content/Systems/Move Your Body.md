Move your body every day. Benefits include improved sleep quality, reduced risk of chronic disease, increased productivity, and reduced anxiety.

The "every day" part is important, because [[Consistency]] is key to most things worth doing.

## Getting Started

Start with 5-10 minutes daily. As noted in [[Motivation Strategies|Encouragements]], "tiny habits deliver big results in a year" and "have no 'Zero-Days.'"

Follow the morning movement advice from [[Motivation Strategies|Encouragements]]: "get some movement in before starting work. Go for a walk, a short bike ride, something outside."

## Movement Options

**Low-intensity:** Walking, stretching, household activities
**Moderate-intensity:** Brisk walking, cycling, swimming  
**High-intensity:** Running, HIIT, sports, strength training

## For Desk Workers

Stand and stretch every 30-60 minutes. Take walking meetings. Use stairs instead of elevators. Regular movement helps counter the negative effects of prolonged sitting.

Movement is a keystone habit that positively influences nearly every aspect of health. The goal is consistency, not perfection.
