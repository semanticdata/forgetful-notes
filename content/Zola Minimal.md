## Introduction

Minimal is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme with the goal of helping you build a light, fast, and SEO ready website. It's based on the [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look

In most cases you only need to modify the content in the `config.toml` file to
custom your blog, including different expressions in your speaking language.

### Custom CSS Styles

Adding your custom css is as easy as adding your own styles to the `sass/_custom.scss` file.
