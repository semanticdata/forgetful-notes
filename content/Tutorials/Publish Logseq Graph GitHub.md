Logseq is a powerful open-source knowledge management tool that emphasizes bidirectional linking and block-level editing. Sharing your graph publicly can be a great way to showcase your knowledge or collaborate with others.

## What You'll Build/Achieve

You'll publish your Logseq graph as a live website accessible to anyone on the internet using GitHub Pages and automated workflows.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Logseq graph in a GitHub repository
- Basic familiarity with GitHub interface

## 1. Open Repository Settings

Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click the **Settings** tab at the top.

## 2. Configure GitHub Pages

In the left sidebar, click **Pages** under the _Code and automation_ section.

## 3. Set Build Source

Under **Build and deployment**, change the **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**. This enables automated publishing whenever you update your graph.

## 4. Access GitHub Actions

Click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repository.

## 5. Run the Publishing Workflow

In the left sidebar, click your workflow (e.g., "Validate and Publish Logseq Graph to GitHub Pages"). Click **Run workflow** on the right, then click the blue **Run workflow** button.

## 6. Wait for Completion

The first run takes several minutes (10+ minutes) as it sets up the publishing environment. Subsequent runs will be much faster (1-2 minutes).

## 7. Set Repository Website URL

Return to your repository's main page and click the âš™ (gear) icon next to "About". Under **Website**, click "Use your GitHub Pages website" to auto-populate your site URL.

## Verification

You'll know it worked when you can visit your GitHub Pages URL (typically `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/`) and see your published Logseq graph.

## Common Issues

**Problem**: Workflow fails on first run  
**Solution**: Check that your repository contains valid Logseq files and the workflow has proper permissions

**Problem**: Site shows 404 error  
**Solution**: Wait a few more minutes after workflow completion - GitHub Pages can take time to propagate

**Problem**: Changes to graph don't appear on website  
**Solution**: Make sure to push your changes to GitHub and re-run the workflow
