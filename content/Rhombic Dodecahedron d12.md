> "I've never seen a rhombic dodecahedron d12 before. They do exist after a quick search, but the much more common d12 is just a dodecahedron, with pentagonal faces."

The UCLA[^1] investigators developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a surprising shapeâ€”the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
