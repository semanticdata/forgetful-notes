A **markup language** is a system for annotating text to define the structure, formatting, and presentation of documents on the web. It uses tags or codes to indicate the purpose or function of different elements within the document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

## Core Principles

Markup languages separate **content from presentation** by using standardized annotations. This separation allows the same content to be displayed differently across various platforms, browsers, and devices while maintaining semantic meaning.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Declarative syntax** - Describes what something is, not how it should look
- **Nested structure** - Elements can contain other elements
- **Attribute system** - Additional information can be attached to elements
- **Platform independence** - Works across different systems and browsers

## Common Web Markup Languages

**[[HTML]]** (Hypertext Markup Language) - The foundational markup language for web pages, defining structure and semantic meaning of web content.

**[[Markdown]]** - A lightweight markup language designed for easy writing and reading, commonly used in [[Digital Garden|Digital Gardens]] and documentation.

## Why Markup Languages Matter

Markup languages enable the **separation of concerns** in web development:

- **Content creators** focus on meaning and structure
- **Designers** handle visual presentation through CSS
- **Developers** add interactivity through JavaScript

This separation makes content more **maintainable**, **accessible**, and **adaptable** across different devices and contexts.

## Semantic vs Presentational

Modern markup emphasizes **semantic meaning** over visual appearance:

```html
<!-- Semantic: Describes what it is -->
<h1>Main Article Title</h1>
<p>Article introduction paragraph...</p>

<!-- Presentational: Describes how it looks -->
<div class="big-bold-text">Main Article Title</div>
<div class="normal-text">Article introduction paragraph...</div>
```

Semantic markup supports accessibility, SEO, and maintainability by clearly indicating the **purpose** of each content element rather than just its appearance.

Understanding markup languages provides the foundation for web content creation, from simple [[Atomic Notes|notes]] to complex web applications.
