A micropolitan statistical area (Î¼SA) is a US labor market and statistical area centered on an urban cluster with a population of at least 10,000 but fewer than 50,000 people. The term became popular in the 1990s to describe growing population centers far from larger cities. While not as economically or politically significant as large cities, micropolitan areas are important centers of population and production, attracting workers and shoppers from a wide local area.

The designation was created in 2003 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

### Criteria for Designation

A micropolitan statistical area consists of a county or group of counties associated with at least one urban cluster of 10,000 to 50,000 people. It also includes adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the core, as measured by commuting ties.

### Distinction from Metropolitan Areas

Micropolitan and metropolitan statistical areas are collectively known as Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The main difference is the population of the urban core. A metropolitan statistical area must have an urban core of at least 50,000 people.
