**Semantic data** is information that has been structured to **explicitly encode meaning and context** rather than merely storing raw values. This approach transforms data from simple storage into a **knowledge representation system** that preserves the significance and relationships inherent in real-world information.

## Core Principles

**Meaning over structure**: While traditional data organization focuses on efficient storage and retrieval, semantic data prioritizes **preserving and expressing the meaning** of information and its real-world significance.

**Explicit relationships**: Rather than implicit connections, semantic data makes relationships between entities **formally defined and machine-readable**. These relationships carry semantic weightâ€”they tell us not just that things are connected, but **how and why** they relate.

**Contextual preservation**: Information maintains its **domain-specific meaning** through structured vocabularies, ontologies, and taxonomies that define concepts within their proper context.

## Semantic Structures

**Ontologies**: Formal representations of knowledge domains that define **concepts, properties, and relationships** within specific areas of understanding. Ontologies provide the vocabulary and rules for describing reality in machine-readable formats.

**Taxonomies**: Hierarchical classification systems that organize concepts from **general to specific**. These create clear parent-child relationships that preserve categorical meaning.

**Knowledge graphs**: Network representations where **entities become nodes** and **relationships become edges**, creating a web of interconnected meaning that mirrors how humans naturally organize knowledge.

## Practical Applications

**Content organization**: Semantic approaches enable more sophisticated content management by **preserving editorial intent** and subject matter relationships rather than relying solely on keywords or chronological ordering.

**Knowledge discovery**: When data preserves semantic relationships, patterns and insights emerge more naturally through **relationship traversal** rather than complex analytical queries.

**Integration across domains**: Semantic frameworks facilitate **cross-domain knowledge synthesis** by providing standardized vocabularies for describing concepts that span multiple areas of expertise.

## Connection to Personal Knowledge

The principles of semantic data directly parallel effective personal knowledge management practices. Creating [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] with clear, focused meaning mirrors semantic data's emphasis on **well-defined entities**. The practice of [[Continuous Care|continuous care]] in a [[Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] reflects the ongoing refinement of semantic relationships.

When we [[Sweep Your Mind|sweep our minds]] and organize thoughts into meaningful categories, we're essentially creating personal ontologies that preserve the **context and significance** of our ideas rather than treating them as isolated information fragments.

## Relationship to Structure

While [[Relational Data|relational data]] emphasizes **mathematical consistency** and structured querying, semantic data prioritizes **meaning preservation** and contextual understanding. Both approaches can complement each other in comprehensive information systems.

Semantic data provides the **conceptual framework** for understanding what information means, while relational structures provide the **organizational foundation** for consistent storage and retrieval.
