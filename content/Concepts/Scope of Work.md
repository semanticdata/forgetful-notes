A **scope of work (SOW)** is a document that gets everyone on the same page about what you're actually building. Think of it as the answer to "wait, what exactly are we doing here?" before things get messy.

## What It Actually Does

An SOW prevents the classic project disasters by answering three basic questions upfront:

- **What** are we delivering (specific stuff, not vague promises)
- **When** will it be done (real dates, not "soon")
- **How** will we know it's finished (clear success criteria)

## When You Need One

Write a scope of work when you're working with other people and need to avoid the inevitable "but I thought you were handling that" conversations. This happens most often with:

- Client projects or freelance work
- Cross-team collaborations  
- Any project involving external vendors
- Work that involves money changing hands

## What Goes In It

A good SOW covers the essentials without getting buried in bureaucracy:

- **Project goals** - what success looks like
- **Timeline** - when things start, major milestones, and when you're done
- **Deliverables** - the actual stuff you'll hand over
- **Conditions** - any weird requirements or constraints
- **Money details** - costs, payment schedule, who approves what
- **Management structure** - who makes decisions and signs off

## Why It Matters

The SOW is your defense against scope creep and the "one more small thing" requests that derail projects. Like [[Scry Your Tasks|task prioritization]], it forces you to be explicit about what's actually important versus what just feels urgent. When someone inevitably wants to add features or change direction, you have a document that says "here's what we agreed toâ€”anything else is a new conversation."
