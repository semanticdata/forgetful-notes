Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am a self-taught hobby developer with too many ideas and not enough time. I was born in the Dominican Republic, and I currently live in Minnesota, US.

I suffer from a chronic case of curiosity, which leads me to learn and do many interesting things like:

- …designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- …creating my own [browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).
- …teaching [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language).
- …learning web development and computer programming.
- …getting licensed as a Firefighter.
- …getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.
- …inspecting public road construction projects.
- …working in a construction materials laboratory.

In my free time, I’m drawn to even more topics, such as public infrastructure, digital gardening, materials science, game development, and personal knowledge management.

## Professional Experience

As an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal . Some of my duties include preparing detailed plans, specifications, solicitations, proposals for bids, and cost estimates; managing contracts from bid solicitation through project completion; and inspecting ongoing and completed construction for compliance with those specifications.

I also maintain accurate project records, review as-built plans, and oversee right-of-way management and permitting. My role involves working closely with various private and public agencies, utilizing GIS and CAD systems, and assisting with Joint Water Commission and Watershed District functions.

## Career Journey

With over 10 years of experience in construction, I have amassed a number of unique projects and experiences that cover many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the time attending INTEC while pursuing a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my college education due to personal reasons.

Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related projects as well. In the past, you could also find me working as a volunteer/on-call Firefighter for the City of Bloomington. If interested, take a look at my resume .
