I'm Miguel Pimentel. I live in Minnesota and work as an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal. While I spend my days managing the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure, I use this site to document my work in software development and data analysis.

This is my [[Digital Garden|digital garden]], where I cultivate thoughts, collect interesting discoveries, and document my ongoing learning journey. Unlike traditional blogs, these notes grow and evolve over time through [[Continuous Care|continuous care]], connected by ideas rather than chronology.

## Professional Background

My daily focus is the delivery of municipal projects. This includes everything from the design of street resurfacing plans to the management of large-scale road and utility contracts. My role requires a balance of technical oversight and coordination. I handle contract specifications, cost estimation, and final construction inspections while ensuring compliance between private agencies and public entities.

I began this journey over twelve years ago as a Civil Engineering Technician in the Dominican Republic. I eventually moved into project management, where I now rely on GIS and CAD systems to manage the lifecycle of physical infrastructure.

With over 10 years in public construction, I've developed a systems-thinking approach that carries over into how I organize knowledge and approach problems—whether technical or otherwise.

## The Self-Directed Path

My approach to expertise is non-traditional. While studying at INTEC, I found that I lacked the drive for traditional academics and eventually moved away from a formal degree. However, as I gained experience in the field, I discovered a profound motivation for learning that school had not sparked.

This shift defined my career. I have spent the last decade in a process of self-directed mastery. I taught myself how to build software and use data analysis to solve specific problems. I believe that an engineer's value is found in the ability to understand a system and improve it, regardless of whether that system is built of concrete or code.

## Areas of Experience

My background is a mix of technical precision and public service:

- **Public Infrastructure**: Managing municipal projects, designing residential road plans in AutoCAD Civil 3D, and overseeing construction site inspections.
- **Digital Tools**: Building Obsidian plugins and Firefox extensions to optimize my personal workflow.
- **Data Analysis**: Developing Python-based prototypes to help stakeholders explore and understand public data, such as our Adopt-a-Drain program.
- **Public Safety**: A past chapter as a licensed Firefighter and EMT, which provided early experience in managing systems under pressure.

## What You'll Find Here

This website is my public notebook. It is a place to connect the dots between engineering management and digital creation. I share content covering:

- **Infrastructure Management**: Insights into public works, contract strategies, and CAD/GIS applications.
- **Software and Automation**: Documentation of my coding projects, technical tutorials, and personal knowledge management.
- **Process Improvement**: Applying an engineering mindset to learning new skills and optimizing workflows.

The garden contains [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]]—focused, self-contained thoughts that can stand alone or connect to form larger ideas. I'm currently implementing a growth system (🌱 seedlings, 🌿 budding, 🌳 evergreen) to indicate the maturity of different notes as they develop.

The **[[Free Facts]]** collection showcases my favorite type of discovery—those wonderfully random pieces of knowledge that serve no practical purpose but satisfy an itch of curiosity. I also maintain a growing collection of **[[words|Words I Like]]** because language fascinates me, and a **[[Uses]]** page documenting the tools that power my daily workflows.
