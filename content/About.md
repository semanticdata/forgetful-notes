## About Me

Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am a self-taught hobby developer with too many ideas and not enough time. I was born in the Dominican Republic, and I currently live in Minnesota, US.

I suffer from a chronic case of curiosity, which leads me to learn and do many interesting things like:

- …designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- …creating my own [browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).
- …teaching [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language).
- …learning web development and computer programming.
- …getting licensed as a Firefighter.
- …getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.
- …inspecting public road construction projects.
- …working in a construction materials laboratory.

### Work Experience

As an Assist. Contract Administrator for [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/), I oversee projects through their installation, construction, and commissioning phases. On a day-to-day basis, I manage multiple projects that tie in one way or another to the public transportation system of the Twins Cities' Metro Area in Minnesota.

With a little over 10 years of experience in public construction, I have amassed a number of unique projects that cover many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the time attending [INTEC](https://www.intec.edu.do/) while pursuing a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my college education due to personal problems.

Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related projects as well.

## About This Site

**Forgetful Notes** is created using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and facilitated by the GitHub [Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If interested, you can browse the [source](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes) code. It has gone through many changes. I have not been shy about moving from technology to technology as I learn new things. Coming across the world of [[Static Site Generators|Static Site Generators]] was a game changer. I have ran my notes through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and most recently [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

However, this site is not specifically built with any of the aforementioned. Instead I have opted to follow in the footsteps of [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) and created my [[Digital Garden|digital garden]] using the new fully rewritten [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)—a set of tools that helps you publish your digital garden and notes as a website for free.

### Technology

All content for the site is written in [[Markdown|Markdown]] within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)—an extensible, flexible note-taking app. To export the notes from Obsidian, I rely on the [GitHub Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin.

The [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes) is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/). From here we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and deploy the site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
