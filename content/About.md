## Hi! I'm Miguel üëãüèº

Problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. I live in Minnesota, also known as the _"Land of 10,000 Lakes"_ for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

### As of September 2023, I am‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ tending to my [digital garden](https://forgetful.dev/).  
‚Ä¶ making simple Firefox [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).  
‚Ä¶ collecting bookmarks with [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).  
‚Ä¶ learning about [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).  
‚Ä¶ slowly teaching myself game development with [L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/).
