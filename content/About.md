## Hi! I'm Miguel üëãüèº

Problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. I live in Minnesota, also known as the _"Land of 10,000 Lakes"_ for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

If you are aching for more:

* Check out what [[./Budding/Tools|tools]] I use daily.
* Read my [[./Public Journal|public journal]].
