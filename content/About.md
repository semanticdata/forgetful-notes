Hi! I'm Miguelâ€”a problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. I live in Minnesota, also known as the _"Land of 10,000 Lakes"_ for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water. I knowâ€¦ it's silly. ðŸ˜…

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

If you are aching for more, check out what [[./Tools|tools]] I use daily, or read my [[Public Journal|public journal]].

### As of February 2024, I amâ€¦

â€¦ learning about web dev with [[./Zola|Zola]].  
â€¦ making simple browser [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).  
â€¦ collecting bookmarks with [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).
