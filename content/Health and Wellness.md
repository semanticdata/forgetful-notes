## The Big and The Bold

* Happiness comes from Solving Problems.
* Turn off problem solving for others.
* Live you own life. Express your emotions.
* Settled for more. Don't push yourself, get _pulled_ by things you enjoy.
* If possible, decide ahead of time. So when time comes, you have already made your decision.
* Be present. Be purposeful when spending my time. Fully commit to conversation. Don't think about what to say. Listen.
* Wages are earned by the hour. Profits are earned while you _sleep_. Make something once, profit from it for the rest of your life.
* Adopt a morning and/or evening routine.
* Take regular breaks and walks.
* Set your intentions each day, week, month, or year.
* Go for walks. Embrace the outside.
* Set a deadline with consequences.
* Make a promise to someone that you'll deliver by a certain time.
* Reduce scope of the project and drop features as the deadline approaches.
* Break the project down into smaller pieces and set milestones for each one to achieve at.
* Design your working environment to promote focus by removing distractions and notifications.

## Ways to Approach Someone Seeking Help

* "Do you want reassurance, potential solutions, or my honest feelings?"
* "Do you want me to listen or to offer help?"

## Journaling…

### …for Problem Solving

* Problems tend to appear bigger than they actually are.
* Journaling, writing about your problems, we minimize them.
* Big problems, require small tasks. Every task is too big.

### …for Stress Management

* Scattered thinking can be stressful. Write the stress out. Digest them.

### … To Create New Habits

* Include a dedicated Journaling session before bed.

## Workflow Optimizations

* **Brevity** - Keep units small. Allows yourself to mark off at a minimum 2-4 tasks per day.
* **Hearing** - Control sounds around you. Use headphones and ADHD music.
* **Distraction** - Minimize distractions. Focus similarly to meditation.
* **Recall** - Use your Todo List to guide you through the day.
* **Techniques** - Give the Pomodoro technique a _serious_ try.
* **Comfort** - Make your work day/space as comfortable as possible. Don't be hard on yourself.

## Self Reflection

1. You Don't Know What You Want
2. You Are Not in Control of Your Physiology. A motivated person looks motivated. The unmotivated person looks unmotivated.
3. You Have Made "lack of motivation" Part of Your Identity. "I'm so stupid" vs "I just did something stupid".
4. You Are Not Aiming High Enough. Lack of exciting and desirable goals leads to low motivation. Apply the 10X Rule.
5. You Are Overwhelmed. Why are you overwhelmed. One goal at a time. Lower the bar.
6. You Are Prone to Procrastination. Ambiguity leads to procrastination, and procrastination leads to a lack of motivation.
7. You Are Not Being Specific Enough to Spur Motivation. When things are vague., motivation will fade. "Wake up earlier." Specific, actionable goals.
8. You Are Seeking Motivation Where You Should Be Seeking Habits
	1. Identify the habit. "Develop a gym habit. Going 5x/week."
	2. Identify your _CUE_. Every habit has a trigger. Alarm -> Waking up.
	3. Identify the _REWARD_. the reward can be anything. The key is the craving.
	4. Execute the _ROUTINE_. Perform the actual activity. "Driving to the gym."
	5. Write it down, make it happen. When _X_, I will do _Y_, because it provides me with _Z_ (reward). Ex.: "When my alarm goes off at 6AM, I will _immediately_ jump out of the bed, and go straight into the bathroom/shower for 20 minutes. Because it provides a good foundation on which to set my day.
