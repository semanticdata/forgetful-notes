## Raindrop.io

In Raindrop.io I collect bookmarks. A subsection of these is curated and published to my Raindrop [public page](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).

Currently, I have these named public collections available:

* Articles
* Firefox Addons (ones made by myself)
* Fun in Minnesota
* GitHub Repos
* Guides
	* Bash Basics (series)
	* Rust Basics (series)
	* Terminal Basics (series)
* Hacker News
* PRIDE Events
* Wikipedia
* Wishlist
