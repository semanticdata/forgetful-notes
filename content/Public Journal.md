## 2023-09-29

### Notes

* It's my birthday! ðŸŽ‰
* Released version 1.1.0 of my Obsidian starter vault.
* Found and added an amazing CSS Layout Hack. Added to both Brave and Firefox bookmarks, and to [[Bookmarklets]]. [Source](https://gist.github.com/growthboot/5c189cf854c6609d3113355c75527c1c)

### GitHub

* Renamed [Zola Tale] to [Mabuya](https://github.com/semanticdata/mabuya).
* Backed up all my current active repositories.
* Emptying [miguel-pimentel-do] to upload new blog.
* Deployed the new blog using [Mabuya].

### Zola Tale

* Added navigation items to the footer. Styled it for both small width screen and full width screens.
* Preparing for rename and redeployment as [MiguelPimentel.do](https://miguelpimentel.do). Finally replacing my old Hugo blog that was really hard to modify.
* Decided to go for [Mabuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector) as the name. References the Hispaniolan two-lined skink (Mabuya hispaniolae). A species of _skink_ _endemic_ to the Dominican Republic.

### Notes

* Made massive changes to [Zola-Tale]. Namely the README.

### Notes

* Revisited a few text editors I have been watching for a bit. Looked at [Lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce), [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl), and [ecode](https://github.com/SpartanJ/ecode). They are looking good, but they are not a point in where I want to dig deeper into using them.

### Zola Tale

* Continue testing. Implemented a new, from the grounds up, dark mode.
* Fully refactored all stylesheets.

### GitHub

* Created a new repo [Obsidian Sample Theme] with the aim to contain my newest project, a Obsidian theme. I have put together some basic CSS properties I'm playing around with.

### Digital Garden

* Synchronized the forked repo with it's base.
* Updated dependencies and _package-lock_.
* Updated the [[Guide|Garden Exploration Guide]]. Added additional links.

### Notes

* Many days worth of changes reported on this entry.
* Updated [[Projects Overview]].
* Started looking at modal editors more seriously. I intend to slowly learn Vim key bindings.
	* I have been reading and watching videos about [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

### Blog

* Testing [Zola Tale] as possible replacement for the blog. It emphasises the writing, only providing an About page for the curious. This has become a more popular idea in my mind. In the past, I have tried to merge my Blog and my digital garden without success. I'm leaning on that. Only articles and an 'About' page will be enough to accomplish the goal I have with the blog. On the other hand, this encourages more people to visit my digital garden, as I plan to write about it on the blog.
* Many changes made to the [Obsidian Starter Vault]. Added two new plugins, and updated the README.
* Contributed [PR #8](https://github.com/zbrox/anpu-zola-theme/pull/8) to add dark mode toggle to the [Anpu](https://github.com/semanticdata/anpu-zola-theme) Zola theme.
* Placed the following projects in _"stand-by"_:
	* [Stressed-dev](https://github.com/semanticdata/stressed-dev)
	* [PurpleWasTaken](https://github.com/semanticdata/purple-was-taken)
	* [Zola Quartz](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-quartz)
	* [Silicon Dioxide](https://github.com/semanticdata/silicon-dioxide)

### Digital Garden

* It has changed domains. Currently being hosted on [forgetfulnotes.com](https://forgetfulnotes.com/).
* After experimenting with the idea of keeping my code base in Quartz v3.3, using Hugo as the base, I felt the amount of effort was unjustified. For now, I have settled on using the latest version of [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) as the base for my [[Digital Garden|digital garden]].
* You can find its source code in [Forgetful Notes](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes).

### Notes

* Added configuration for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/semanticdata/dotfiles) repo.
* I have been trying out Brave's vertical tabs. Initially, I didn't like them, and as I continue to review, I keep finding myself liking them less and less. I am not quite sure why the vertical tabs implementation in the Firefox sidebar feels much better to me. I am done trying the feature out. They did not fit my current workflow. The implementation left a lot to be desired.
* Trying out Brave's vertical tabs. Initially, I do not like it.
* Created a new repo to hold my [dotfiles](https://github.com/semanticdata/dotfiles) and configurations.

### Silicon Dioxide

* Expanded adjustments and changes made to [Silicon Dioxide](https://github.com/semanticdata/silicon-dioxide) repo.
* Fully rebranded from Quartz (port) to Silicon Dioxide.
* Deployed the site using GitHub Pages.
* Consolidated changes previously made to **Forgetful Notes** into **Silicon Dioxide**.

## 2023-09-01

### Notes

* Renamed multiple GitHub repos. Namely, `hugo-lowkey` was renamed to [miguel-pimentel-do](https://github.com/semanticdata/miguel-pimentel-do), `hugo-quartz` was renamed to [stressed-dev](https://github.com/semanticdata/stressed-dev). Both, together with [forgetful-dev](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-dev), are now named based on their domains.
* Created new repos [test-hugo-lowkey](https://github.com/semanticdata/test-hugo-lowkey), and [test-hugo-quartz](https://github.com/semanticdata/test-hugo-quartz) to test GitHub Actions. This proved fruitful as I was able to understand, simplify builds, and deployments. Mainly, eliminated the need to deploy Quartz v3.3 from the `gh-pages` branch.

### Digital Garden

* _"Downgraded"_ from [Quartz v4.0.7](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-dev) to [Quartz v3.3](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo) in an effort to retain control of fewer moving parts.
* It is no longer hosted in [forgetful-dev](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-dev). It can now be found in newly created [purple-was-taken](https://github.com/semanticdata/purple-was-taken); which also follows the domain naming convention mentioned in the first bullet point.

## 2023-08-30

### Notes

* Started work on a new repo, [obsidian-starter-vault](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault). Aiming to release an Obsidian start-up setup I like.

### Blog

* Published (again) the guide to [[Unlock Firefox Sidebar]] after reading a comment in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) asking for exactly that. I responded with a link to the article on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/semanticdata/unlock-the-sidebar-width-in-firefox-22p0). Originally, I removed the guide from my [blog](https://miguelpimentel.do) because I didn't think it fit with the content at the time.
* Overhauled Taxonomies (Categories and Tags) within the [blog](https://miguelpimentel.do). Created specific pages to format the titles, and define how the taxonomy pages are displayed/organized.

### Digital Garden

* Compiled, and published a collection of [[Bookmarklets]].
* Cleaned up and published [[Inspirations]].
* Making the Garden more explorable by adding direct links to the [tags] page from the [Homepage].
* Playing with the Garden's desktop layout. Temporarily moved right sidebar components to the left sidebar. Undone shortly after, as it messed with the total calculated width of the page and its two sidebar widths.

* About a week ago I upgraded my [[Digital Garden|digital garden]] from [Quartz v3.3] to [Quartz v4-Alpha].
* Today I upgraded the Garden backend from [Quartz v4-Alpha] to the official [Quartz v4] release.
