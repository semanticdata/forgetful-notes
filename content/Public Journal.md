## 2023

### December

- Created a new Firefox extension to hold [ChatGPT in the Sidebar](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-chatgpt-in-sidebar).
- Started learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with the aim to create a Milkdown markdown editor web app.
- Started learning [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). I would like to use it in conjunction with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to create better looking websites.
- I intend to restart using [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) to help with repetitive work phrases, addresses, contractors, etc.

### November

- Created a new Firefox extension, [WhatsApp Pinned](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-ticktick-pinned), and [TickTick Pinned](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-ticktick-pinned) which toggle their respective web apps in a pinned tab.
- Ported the Chrome extension [Text Revealer](https://github.com/jamigibbs/text-revealer-chrome-extension) to Firefox. [Source](https://github.com/semanticdata/text-revealer-firefox-extension)
