An **arpeggio** is a type of [[Chords|broken chord]] in which the notes that compose a chord are individually sounded in a progressive rising or descending order. The word "arpeggio" comes from the Italian word "arpeggiare," which means "to play like a harp."

## What Makes an Arpeggio

While [[Chords|chords]] are played with all notes sounding simultaneously, arpeggios break those same notes into a melodic sequence. This creates a flowing, lyrical sound that's fundamental to many musical styles.

**Key characteristics:**

- Uses the same notes as the parent chord
- Notes are played individually, not together  
- Can ascend, descend, or use mixed patterns
- Creates melodic movement from harmonic material

## Basic Arpeggio Patterns

### Guitar Arpeggios

**Simple C Major Arpeggio** (using open strings):

```text
e|--------0-----------------|
B|------1---1---------------|
G|----0-------0-------------|
D|--2-----------------------|
A|--------------------------|
E|--------------------------|
```

This pattern plays C - E - G - C (the notes of C major chord) in ascending order.

**Fingerpicking Pattern:**

- Use thumb (T) for bass notes (lower strings)
- Use index (I), middle (M), ring (A) fingers for higher strings
- Common pattern: T-I-M-A for four-note arpeggios

### Piano Arpeggios

**Right Hand C Major Arpeggio:**

- **Ascending:** C - E - G - C (using fingers 1-2-3-5)
- **Descending:** C - G - E - C (using fingers 5-3-2-1)

**Left Hand C Major Arpeggio:**

- **Ascending:** C - E - G - C (using fingers 5-3-2-1)  
- **Descending:** C - G - E - C (using fingers 1-2-3-5)

## Common Arpeggio Types

### Major Arpeggios

Built from major [[Chords|chords]] using root, major third, and perfect fifth:

- **C Major:** C - E - G
- **G Major:** G - B - D
- **F Major:** F - A - C

### Minor Arpeggios  

Built from minor [[Chords|chords]] using root, minor third, and perfect fifth:

- **A Minor:** A - C - E
- **E Minor:** E - G - B
- **D Minor:** D - F - A

### Seventh Arpeggios

Include the seventh note for more sophisticated sound:

- **Cmaj7:** C - E - G - B
- **Am7:** A - C - E - G
- **G7:** G - B - D - F

## Playing Techniques

### Guitar

- **Alternate picking** - Down and up strokes for even tone
- **Fingerstyle** - Individual finger control for each string
- **Sweep picking** - Advanced technique for rapid arpeggios
- **Legato** - Smooth connection between notes

### Piano

- **Wrist rotation** - Gentle circular motion for fluid playing
- **Finger independence** - Each finger moves clearly and separately
- **Pedaling** - Use sustain pedal to connect notes smoothly
- **Dynamic control** - Vary volume for musical expression

## Musical Applications

### Accompaniment Patterns

Arpeggios create flowing accompaniment behind melodies:

- **Waltz style** - Bass note on beat 1, arpeggio on beats 2-3
- **Ballad style** - Gentle, sustained arpeggios throughout

### Melodic Development

Transform chord progressions into melodic lines:

- Use arpeggio notes as foundation for improvisation
- Connect different chord arpeggios to create longer phrases

### Classical and Fingerstyle

Essential technique in:

- **Classical guitar** repertoire
- **Fingerstyle arrangements** of popular songs
- **Piano Ã©tudes** and technical studies

## Practice Strategies

### Start Simple

- Begin with major and minor triads only
- Use slow tempo until finger patterns are secure
- Practice ascending and descending separately

### Pattern Development  

- Learn common fingering patterns that work across multiple chords
- Practice the same arpeggio pattern on different chord types
- Gradually increase tempo while maintaining clean articulation

### Musical Context

- Practice arpeggios within actual song progressions
- Combine with [[Chords|chord]] playing for complete arrangements
- Listen to how professional musicians use arpeggios in different styles

Arpeggios bridge the gap between [[Chords|harmonic]] and melodic playing, making them essential for developing both technical skill and musical understanding on any instrument.
