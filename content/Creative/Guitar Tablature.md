**Guitar tablature** (or "tabs") is a simplified musical notation system that shows exactly where to place your fingers on the guitar fretboard. Unlike traditional sheet music, tabs are instrument-specific and immediately show you the physical finger positions.

## Reading Tab Basics

### The Six Lines

Tab consists of six horizontal lines representing the guitar strings:

```text
e|--------------------------|  (1st string - thinnest, high E)
B|--------------------------|  (2nd string)
G|--------------------------|  (3rd string)  
D|--------------------------|  (4th string)
A|--------------------------|  (5th string)
E|--------------------------|  (6th string - thickest, low E)
```

**Important:** The bottom line represents the lowest (thickest) string, while the top line represents the highest (thinnest) string. This matches how you see the strings when looking down at your guitar.

### Numbers on the Lines

Numbers indicate which fret to press:

- **0** = Open string (no fret pressed)
- **1** = 1st fret
- **2** = 2nd fret
- **3** = 3rd fret, and so on...

### Reading Direction

Read from left to right, just like text. Numbers stacked vertically are played simultaneously ([[chords|chords]]), while numbers in sequence are played one after another.

## Basic Tab Examples

### Simple Scale Pattern

```text
e|--0--1--3--5--|
B|--------------|
G|--------------|
D|--------------|
A|--------------|
E|--------------|
```

This shows playing frets 0, 1, 3, then 5 on the high E string.

### Simple [[Chords|Chord]]

```text
e|--0--|
B|--1--|
G|--0--|
D|--2--|
A|--3--|
E|-----|
```

This shows a C major chord - all numbers played simultaneously.

### [[Arpeggio]] Pattern

```text
B|------1---1---------------|
G|----0-------0-------------|
D|--2-----------------------|
A|--------------------------|
E|--------------------------|
```

This shows a C major arpeggio - notes played one after another.

## Real Song Example

### Metallica â€“ Enter the Sandman (Intro)

```text
e|---------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|
B|---------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|
G|---------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|
D|-------5-------------|----5-------------|----5----------|--------------------|
A|----7-----------7----|-7-----------7----|-7-----------7-|--------------------|
E|-0--------6--5-----0-|-------6--5-----0-|-------6--5----|--------------------|
```

**How to play this:**

1. Start with open low E string (0)
2. 7th fret on A string
3. 6th fret on low E string
4. 5th fret on low E string
5. 5th fret on D string
6. Back to open low E string

**Finger placement tip:** Use your 3rd finger for 7th fret, 2nd finger for 6th fret, and 1st finger for 5th fret positions.

## Common Tab Symbols

### Basic Techniques

- **h** = Hammer-on (5h7 means fret 5, then hammer to 7)
- **p** = Pull-off (7p5 means fret 7, then pull off to 5)  
- **b** = Bend (7b9 means bend 7th fret to sound like 9th fret)
- **r** = Release bend
- **/** = Slide up (\\ = slide down)
- **~** = Vibrato
- **x** = Muted string/dead note

### Advanced Symbols

- **PM** = Palm muting
- **^** = Bend (alternative notation)
- **()** = Optional note or ghost note
- **|** = Bar line (separates measures)

## Reading Tips for Beginners

### Start Simple

- Focus on single-note passages before attempting [[Chords|chords]]
- Practice reading one string at a time
- Use slow tempo until finger positions become automatic

### Finger Numbers

While not always shown in tabs, standard fingering:

- **1st finger** = Index finger (1st and 2nd frets typically)
- **2nd finger** = Middle finger
- **3rd finger** = Ring finger  
- **4th finger** = Pinky finger

### Timing and Rhythm

Basic tabs don't show timing - you need to:

- Listen to the original song for rhythm
- Count along with a metronome
- Some advanced tabs include rhythm notation above the fret numbers

## Writing Your Own Tabs

### Tools Needed

- Text editor or specialized tab software
- Reference recording for timing
- Guitar to verify finger positions

### Format Consistency

- Keep string lines aligned
- Use consistent spacing for timing
- Include chord names above complex sections
- Add technique symbols clearly

### Practical Applications

- Transcribe your favorite riffs and solos
- Share arrangements with other guitarists  
- Create practice exercises for specific techniques
- Document your own compositions

Guitar tablature provides immediate visual feedback for finger placement, making it an essential skill for learning songs quickly and communicating musical ideas with other guitarists. Combined with understanding [[Chords|chords]] and [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]], tab reading opens up a vast library of guitar music.
