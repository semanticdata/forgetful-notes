A **chord** is any harmonic set of pitches consisting of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. Chords form the harmonic foundation of most Western music and are essential for both guitar and piano players.

## Basic Chord Construction

Chords are built using **intervals** - the distance between notes. The most fundamental chord is the **triad**, which contains three notes:

- **Root** - The foundation note that gives the chord its name
- **Third** - Determines if the chord sounds major or minor
- **Fifth** - Provides stability and fullness to the chord

### Major vs Minor Chords

**Major chords** sound bright and happy:

- Built with a major third (4 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones) from the root
- Example: C major = C + E + G

**Minor chords** sound darker or sadder:

- Built with a minor third (3 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones) from the root  
- Example: C minor = C + Eb + G

## Essential Beginner Chords

### Guitar - Open Chord Shapes

These chords use open strings and are foundational for beginners:

**Major Chords:**

- **C Major** - Easy starter chord, uses 1st, 2nd, and 3rd frets
- **G Major** - Common in many songs, spans multiple frets
- **D Major** - Triangle shape, good for building finger strength
- **A Major** - Three fingers in a row
- **E Major** - Simple two-finger chord

**Minor Chords:**

- **A minor** - Similar to A major but easier
- **E minor** - Easiest chord, only two fingers
- **D minor** - Small stretch required

### Piano - Basic Triads

Piano chords use the same theory but are played differently:

**Major Chords (White keys only):**

- **C Major** - C, E, G (all white keys)
- **F Major** - F, A, C  
- **G Major** - G, B, D

**Minor Chords:**

- **A minor** - A, C, E (all white keys)
- **D minor** - D, F, A
- **E minor** - E, G, B

## Chord Progressions

**Chord progressions** are sequences of chords that create musical movement. Common beginner progressions include:

### I-V-vi-IV Progression

One of the most popular progressions in Western music:

- **In C Major:** C - G - Am - F
- **In G Major:** G - D - Em - C

This progression appears in countless songs across all genres.

### ii-V-I Progression  

Common in jazz but useful for all styles:

- **In C Major:** Dm - G - C
- Creates strong resolution back to the home chord

## Playing Techniques

### Guitar

- **Strumming** - Use downstrokes initially, then add upstrokes
- **Finger placement** - Press just behind the frets, not on them
- **Clean switching** - Practice chord changes slowly before speeding up

### Piano  

- **Hand position** - Curved fingers, relaxed wrist
- **Voicing** - Try playing the same chord in different octaves
- **Inversions** - Play the same chord with different notes in the bass

## Chord Extensions

As you advance, chords can include additional notes:

- **7th chords** - Add the seventh note of the scale (Cmaj7, C7, Cm7)
- **9th chords** - Include the ninth note for jazz flavor
- **Sus chords** - Suspend the third with either the 2nd or 4th note

## Practical Applications

### Song Analysis

Most popular songs use only 3-4 chords. Start by learning to identify and play common progressions in your favorite songs.

### Practice Tips

- **Start slow** - Perfect the chord shapes before worrying about timing
- **Use a metronome** - Develop steady rhythm while changing chords
- **Practice transitions** - Focus on moving between specific chord pairs

### [[Arpeggio|Arpeggios]]

When chord notes are played individually rather than simultaneously, they become arpeggios - an essential technique for both instruments.

## Common Chord Symbols

Understanding chord symbols helps you read lead sheets and chord charts:

- **C** = C major
- **Cm** = C minor  
- **C7** = C dominant 7th
- **Cmaj7** = C major 7th
- **Csus4** = C suspended 4th

Mastering basic chords provides the foundation for playing rhythm parts, accompanying singers, and understanding harmonic structure across all musical styles.
