Color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. It includes categories, schemes, and definitions of colors based on the color wheel. Understanding color theory is fundamental for creating visually appealing and effective designs, as colors evoke emotions, convey meaning, and establish visual hierarchy.

## Key Concepts

* **Color Wheel:** A circular diagram showing the relationships between colors, used to illustrate color relationships and schemes.
* **Primary Colors:** Red, yellow, and blue (in traditional subtractive color theory, used in pigments) – these are the foundational colors that cannot be created by mixing other colors. In additive color theory (light), primary colors are red, green, and blue (RGB).
* **Secondary Colors:** Colors created by mixing two primary colors (e.g., green from blue and yellow; orange from red and yellow; purple from red and blue).
* **Tertiary Colors:** Colors created by mixing a primary and a secondary color (e.g., red-orange, blue-green).
* **Complementary Colors:** Colors opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green, blue and orange, yellow and purple). They create high contrast and can make designs pop, but should be used carefully to avoid visual vibration.
* **Analogous Colors:** Colors next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, green). They create harmonious and serene designs, often found in nature.
* **Triadic Colors:** Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel, forming a triangle (e.g., red, yellow, blue). This scheme offers strong visual contrast while retaining harmony and richness.
* **Monochromatic Colors:** Different shades, tints, and tones of a single hue. This scheme provides a subtle and cohesive look.
* **Hue:** The pure color (e.g., red, blue, green) – the dominant color family.
* **Saturation:** The intensity or purity of a color. High saturation means a vivid, strong color; low saturation means a duller, more muted color.
* **Value (Brightness):** The lightness or darkness of a color. Adding white increases value (tint), and adding black decreases value (shade).
* **Warm Colors:** Colors like red, orange, and yellow, which tend to evoke warmth, energy, and excitement. They often appear to advance in a composition.
* **Cool Colors:** Colors like blue, green, and purple, which tend to evoke calmness, serenity, and professionalism. They often appear to recede in a composition.
