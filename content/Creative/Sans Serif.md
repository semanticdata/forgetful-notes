In typography and lettering, a "sans-serif", "sans serif", "gothic", or simply "sans" letterform is one that does not have extending features called "serifs" at the end of strokes. The term comes from the French word "sans", meaning "without". Sans-serif typefaces tend to have less stroke width variation than serif typefaces. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism and have become the most common typefaces for displaying text on computer screens.

Some popular examples of sans-serif fonts include Futura, Frutiger, Franklin Gothic, and Helvetica.
