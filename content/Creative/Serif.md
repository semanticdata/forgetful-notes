In typography, a serif (/ˈsɛrɪf/) is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or family of fonts. Serif typefaces are widely used for body text because they are considered easier to read in long passages.

The origin of the term "serif" is uncertain, but it may come from the Dutch word "schreef" meaning "line" or "pen-stroke".
