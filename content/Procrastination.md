1. Shower in the morning.
2. Do not multitaskâ€”our brain is single-threaded.
3. Turn your daily habits into a game.
4. Get some movement in before starting work. Go for a walk, a short bike ride, something outside.
5. Tiny habits deliver big results in a year.
6. If you want to change, start with the type of content you consume.
7. Stop obsessing over productivity hacks and actually start working on your backlog.
8. Have no "Zero-Days." Get something, anything at all done everyday. No matter how small.
9. Don't oversleep, wake up at a standard time each workday, and start work at a standard time each day.
10. Stop watchin the news.
11. Eat the Frog. Identify one challenging task (the frong), and complete it first thing in the morning (thus eating it).
12. Fix and maintain a healthy sleep schedule.
13. It doesn't need to be perfect, it does need to be started.
14. Consistency is more important than intensity.
