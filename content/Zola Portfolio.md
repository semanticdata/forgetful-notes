## Introduction

Portfolio is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme. It's based on the [Portfolio](https://github.com/jamigibbs/portfolio) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is not yet finished.

## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) â‰¥ 0.17.2.

## Quick Start

## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `theme.toml` and templates files in this repo for an idea.

In most cases you only need to modify the content in the `config.toml` file to
custom your blog, including different expressions in your speaking language.

### Custom CSS Styles

Adding your custom css is as easy as adding your own styles to the `sass/_custom.scss` file.

| ------------ | --------------- |
| `zola build` | Build only      |
