ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to interact in a conversational way, allowing it to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. It is built upon the GPT architecture, which is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code.

> ChatGPT's ability to maintain context and generate coherent, relevant responses has made it a groundbreaking tool for communication, content creation, and information retrieval.

## Core Technology

- **Transformer Architecture**: The model is based on the transformer architecture, which uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence.
- **Pre-training**: It is pre-trained on a diverse corpus of text from the internet, learning grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and a representation of the world.
- **Fine-Tuning**: After pre-training, it is fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to make it safer, more helpful, and better at following instructions.

## Key Features

- **Conversational Context**: It can remember previous messages in a conversation and use that context to inform its responses.
- **Versatility**: It can perform a wide variety of tasks, including writing essays, debugging code, translating languages, and composing music.
- **Code Generation**: It is proficient in many programming languages and can generate code snippets, explain algorithms, and help with debugging.

## Custom Instructions

One of the powerful features of ChatGPT is the ability to provide custom instructions to guide its personality and response format. This allows users to tailor the model's behavior to their specific needs.

### Example Custom Instruction

> You are a fine-tuned autoregressive model skilled in reasoning. Provide nuanced, factual answers, and flag uncertainties. Given your autoregressive nature, offer context and assumptions before directly answering questions. Your users are AI and ethics experts, so skip reminders about your limitations and ethical concerns.

This instruction sets a specific persona for the model, influencing its tone, level of detail, and the assumptions it makes about the user's expertise.

## Use Cases

- **Content Creation**: Drafting emails, articles, and marketing copy.
- **Education**: Acting as a tutor to explain complex topics.
- **Software Development**: Writing, documenting, and debugging code.
- **Brainstorming**: Generating ideas for a wide range of creative and business problems.

ChatGPT and models like it (e.g., [[Claude]]) represent a major advancement in artificial intelligence, providing a powerful and accessible interface for interacting with vast amounts of information and generating new content.
