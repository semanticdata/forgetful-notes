> **Forgetful Notes** is created using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and facilitated by the GitHub [Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If interested, you can browse the [source](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes) code.

## Background

Forgetful Notes has gone through many changes. I have not been shy about moving from technology to technology as I learn new things. Coming across the world of [[Static Site Generators|Static Site Generators]] was a game changer. I have ran my notes through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and most recently [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

However, this site is not specifically built with any of the aforementioned. Instead I have opted to follow in the footsteps of [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) and created my [[Digital Garden|digital garden]] using the new fully rewritten [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)—a set of tools that helps you publish your digital garden and notes as a website for free.

## Technology

All content for the site is written in [[Markdown|Markdown]] within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)—an extensible, flexible note-taking app. To export the notes from Obsidian, I rely on the [GitHub Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin.

The [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes) is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/). From here we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and deploy the site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
